v1.2.0
------------

  ExifExtractor.java
    - Proper traversing of Exif file structure and complete refactor & tidy of
      the codebase (a few unnoticed bugs removed)
    - Reads makernote data for 6 families of camera (5 makes)
    - Tags now stored in directories... use the IFD_* constants to refer to the
      image file directory you require (Exif, Interop, GPS and Makernote*) --
      this avoids collisions where two tags share the same code
    - No longer decodes image to extract Exif data -- this is much faster
    - Takes componentCount of unknown tags into account
    - Now understands GPS tags (thanks to Colin Briton for his help with this)
    - Returns null when no Exif data present, instead of throwing an exception
    - Some other bug fixes, pointed out by users around the world.  Thanks!

  ExifLoader
    - Removed (unnecessary)

  ImageInfo.java
    - Stored IFD directories in separate tag-spaces
    - iterator() now returns an Iterator over a list of TagValue objects
    - More get*Description() methods to detail GPS tags, among others

  TagValue.java
    - New class to encapsualte information about a particular tag

  Rational.java
    - Improved toSimpleString() to factor more complex rational numbers into
      a simpler form
        i.e.
          10/15 -> 2/3
    - toSimpleString() now accepts a boolean flag, 'allowDecimals' which will
      display the rational number in decimal form if it fits within 5 digits
        i.e.
          3/4 -> 0.75 when allowDecimal == true

  JpegSegmentReader
    - New class to extract APP1 segment (and others) from a Jpeg file -- this
      avoids decoding images just to get metadata

  tests\*.java
    - First collection of basic unit tests, to compile against JUnit
    - Doesn't yet cover all classes

  Website
    - A collection of JPEGs from various digital camera models, collected on
      the web and contributed by many users of ExifExtractor
    - Updated documentation


v1.1.1
------------

  Rational.java
    - Added toSimpleString() method, which returns a simplified and hopefully
      more readable version of the Rational
        i.e.
          2/10 -> 1/5
          10/2 -> 5

  ExifExtractor.java
    - Removed unnecessary casting operations
    - Added a few more comments
    - Removed redundant and commented code (I'm using a CVS system now)

  ExifLoader.java
    - Added a much-needed close() call to a created input stream, allowing
      continued use of the File object passed to ExifLoader.getImageInfo(File)

  ImageInfo.java
    - Make use of new Rational method toSimpleString() for more elegant output -
      Use of DecimalFormatter to tidy output in selected get***Description() methods

v1.1.0
------------

  - Descriptive tag values, including units and text for enumerations
  - Decoupling from JDK 1.4-specific libraries (tested with JDK 1.3)
  - More complete list of tags, both as constants for direct lookup, and via the
    static lookup method

v1.0
------------

  - Initial release
